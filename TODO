adopt some test suite
correct parallel modes that are stil expecting y|n to reflect help-text
change ELM-scala and ML-scala to have version file also or another thing
X and HHinv are calculated even when it is useless in ConvergenteELM! lazy is ineffective in call-by-value
implement update and updateall for intera, EM and OS
implement fast_mutable in all ELMs
optimize update for "weak" ELMs (as a replacement for the present full rebuild)
test whether batch update() is working
